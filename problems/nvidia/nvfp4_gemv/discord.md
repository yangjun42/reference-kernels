You will implement a batched matrix-vector multiplication kernel optimized for NVIDIA B200.
To be explicit, you will be given a tuple of tensors:
(a, b, sfa, sfb, c)

where:
a is M x K x L in K-major order in nvfp4(e2m1)
b is 1 x K x L in K-major order in nvfp4(e2m1)
sfa is M x (K // 16) x L in K-major order in fp8(e4m3fnuz)
sfb is 1 x (K // 16) x L in K-major order in fp8(e4m3fnuz)
c is M x 1 x L in fp16

Matrix sizes M is divisible by mma_tiler_mn[0] defined in the kernel, K is divisible by 64.
The ranking criteria is the geometric mean of the benchmark results.
For the grand price, your kernel will be evaluated against the speed of light analysis
and the solution closest to the speed of light will be awarded the grand price.
The speed of light analysis based on the max(FFMA math throughput, DRAM memory throughput) of B200 and tested under 1.5Ghz clock:
M    K     L time[us]
7168 16384 1 8.622
4096 7168  8 17.275
7168 2048  4 4.317
